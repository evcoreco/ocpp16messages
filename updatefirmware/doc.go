// Package updatefirmware implements the Open Charge Point Protocol (OCPP) 1.6
// UpdateFirmware message for EV charging.
//
// # Handling Rules
//
// The Central System MAY instruct a Charge Point to update its firmware using
// UpdateFirmware.req. The request contains:
//   - The earliest date and time when the Charge Point is allowed to retrieve
//     the firmware.
//   - The location (URL or path) from which the firmware can be downloaded.
//
// # Charge Point Behavior
//
//   - Upon receipt of UpdateFirmware.req, the Charge Point SHALL respond with
//     UpdateFirmware.conf.
//   - The Charge Point SHOULD start retrieving the firmware as soon as
//     possible after the allowed retrieve-date.
//   - During download and installation, the Charge Point MUST send
//     FirmwareStatusNotification.req PDUs to keep the Central System updated
//     on progress.
//
// # Installation Rules
//
//   - The Charge Point SHALL install the new firmware once it has verified
//     the firmware image is valid.
//   - If installation cannot safely occur during an ongoing charging session,
//     it is RECOMMENDED to wait until the session ends.
//   - Connectors not in use SHOULD be set to UNAVAILABLE while waiting for
//     idle conditions.
//
// # Optional Best Practices
//
//   - Rebooting the Charge Point after installation before sending
//     "Installed" status is recommended to verify connectivity and firmware
//     integrity, but is not mandatory.
